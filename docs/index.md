# EVO Next Generation
EVO-NG is the successor EVO which applies same idea but in different point of view. EVO was built to become an app engine, but EVO-NG has built to become versatile,flexible and highly customizable app engine.

### Aims of NG:
- Treat golang as an interpreter language, yet it is compiled
- Highly customizable without sacrificing anything
- Reusable/Customizable painlessly
- Ready for scaled and distributed systems
- Yet high performance

## ⚠️ Important

EVO-NG works only with Go [modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules). `GOPATH` mode is likely to break most of the functionality of the EVO-NG eco-system.

Also, the EVO-NG actively gives support to the last 2 versions of Go, which at the moment are:

- 1.16.x
- 1.17.x

While EVO-NG `may` work on older versions, we encourage you to upgrade to latest 2 versions of Go for a better development experience.
